# News Collective
### Powered by NewsAPI ###
A dynamic, single-page news app for reading the top 10 headlines from a variety of news sources. This app offers a convenient alternative to visiting each publisher individually.

Currently Working On:
- Transition to progressive web app, so it can be downloaded through the app store and used offline.
- Allowing users to create a custom profile from the over 30,000 news sources, so they can create a custom newsfeed based on their own interests
